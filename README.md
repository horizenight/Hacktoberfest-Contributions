    - Run the commands.
        - `git config --global user.name "Your name"`
        - `git config --global user.email "Your email address"` 
 - Optionally, you can [setup ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to authenticate easily. 

### What to Contribute

You are free to select any topic such as Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Web Development, etc. Your contribution can be **your mini-project**, **algorithms**, **solution to coding problem**, etc. Just make sure to follow the below guidelines strictly.

## How to contribute?

Refer to [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Learn-Write-Repeat/Hacktoberfest-Contributions/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to setup the repository.

Once you are ready with the setup, follow the below guidelines:

1. Create a folder inside contributions folder with the Topic Name in snake case, i.e., if your topic is URL Shortener using Flask, the folder name should be **url_shortener_using_flask**.

2. Create a markdown file called README.md inside the folder and describe your topic. The description can be **Problem statement of your code**, **Algorithm description**, or something that is relevant to your code.

3. Also, add screenshots, or codes, or Jupyter notebooks inside the same folder.

4. After adding these files, you can create a pull request.
